and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.0.3] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed

- **Restored `skills/` and `.claude-plugin/` to the plugin install tarball.** v3.0.1 added `.gitattributes` rules that excluded both directories from `git archive` output to shrink the claude.ai `.skill` bundle. Claude Code's `/plugin install` fetches the same archive, so users installing v3.0.1 or v3.0.2 received a tarball with no plugin manifest and no skill files. `git archive v3.0.0` contained 8 files under those paths; `v3.0.1` and `v3.0.2` contained 0. This release reverts those `.gitattributes` lines.
- **Reverted `plugin.json` `"skills"` field to `["./"]`.** v3.0.2 changed this to `["skills"]` based on a misdiagnosis — the manifest change had no effect because the manifest wasn't in the tarball at all. The historical `["./"]` value shipped in every release from v2.1.0 through v3.0.0 without issues and is restored here.

### Recovery

Users on v3.0.1 or v3.0.2: run `/plugin update last30days` then `/reload-plugins`. If autoUpdate is enabled, the next session start will pull v3.0.3 automatically. Users on cached v3.0.0 or earlier installs were unaffected.

### Notes

- The claude.ai `.skill` bundle built by `scripts/build-skill.sh` still works — the archive grew from 89 to 97 files, well under the 200-file cap.
- claude.ai-specific exclusions (avoiding duplicate `SKILL.md` files in the bundle) should move into `scripts/build-skill.sh` rather than `.gitattributes` in a future release, since `.gitattributes` cannot distinguish between the two distribution channels.

## [3.0.2] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed

- **`/last30days` slash command now registers on Claude Code v2.1.105+.** `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` declared `"skills": ["./"]`, which newer Claude Code rejects with `Path escapes plugin directory: ./ (skills)`. The skill silently failed to register, so `/last30days <query>` returned "Unknown command" even though `/plugin list` showed the plugin as installed. Fix: `"skills": ["skills"]` so the loader scans the real skill subdirectory.
- **Version drift between manifests.** `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` was pinned to `3.0.0` while `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` advertised `3.0.1`. The `/plugin` resolver used the marketplace version and could install stale cached metadata alongside the correct build. Both manifests now agree on `3.0.2`.

### Recovery

If `/last30days` stopped working for you, run `/plugin update last30days` then `/reload-plugins`. If `/doctor` still reports errors, uninstall and reinstall the plugin from the marketplace.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed

- **Skill upload packaging** - `scripts/build-skill.sh` produces a claude.ai-upload-ready `.skill` file that fits under the 200-file cap. Previously, zipping the repo hit 406 files and the "Upload skill" UI rejected it outright.
- **SKILL.md description length** - trimmed from 228 to 167 chars (Anthropic caps descriptions at 200).

### Removed

- Unused root `vendor/` directory (215 files from an accidental commit in PR #48 - the real vendored X client lives at `scripts/lib/vendor/bird-search/`).
- Legacy top-level `plans/` directory (superseded by `docs/plans/`; both plans described work that was already shipped in v3).

### Added

- `.gitattributes` with `export-ignore` entries so `git archive` drops tests, docs, fixtures, assets, historical manifests, and internal skill subdirs. Mirrors Anthropic's canonical `package_skill.py` exclusions.
- `scripts/build-skill.sh` - one-command path to produce `dist/last30days.skill` with a single top-level `last30days/` folder, defensive `=200` file check, and dirty-tree refusal.
- `README.md` section documenting the claude.ai skill upload workflow.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-04-11

### Highlights

Intelligent search, fun judge, cross-source cluster merging, single-pass comparisons, and OpenClaw as a first-class citizen. The v3 engine doesn't just search for your topic -- it figures out *where* to search before the search begins. Engine architecture by @j-sperling.

### Added

- **Intelligent pre-research** -- Resolves X handles, subreddits, TikTok hashtags, and YouTube channels via a new Python brain before any API calls fire. Bidirectional: person to company, product to founder.
- **Fun judge / Best Takes** -- Second parallel LLM judge scores humor, cleverness, and virality. Surfaces the best reactions in a dedicated output section.
- **Cross-source cluster merging** -- Entity-based overlap detection merges the same story across Reddit, X, YouTube into one cluster instead of three separate items.
- **Single-pass comparisons** -- "X vs Y" runs one pass with entity-aware subqueries instead of three serial passes. 3 minutes instead of 12+.
- **GitHub as a source** -- Stars, reactions, and comments from repos and issues.
- **OpenClaw first-class citizen** -- Auto-resolve for engine-side pre-research. Device auth for frictionless ScrapeCreators signup.
- **Per-author cap** -- Max 3 items per author prevents single-voice dominance.
- **Entity disambiguation** -- Synthesis trusts resolved handles over keyword matches.
- **Perplexity Sonar Pro as additive source** -- AI-synthesized research with citations via OpenRouter. Opt-in via `INCLUDE_SOURCES=perplexity`. Returns structured narratives that complement social data.
- **Perplexity Deep Research** -- `--deep-research` flag for exhaustive 50+ citation reports (~$0.90/query). Premium opt-in for serious investigation.
- **OpenRouter as reasoning provider** -- One OPENROUTER_API_KEY powers planning, reranking, and Perplexity search. Auto-detected after Gemini/OpenAI/xAI.
- **Parallel AI grounding backend** -- `--web-backend parallel` or auto-detected via PARALLEL_API_KEY.
- **Grounding in planner** -- Grounding source properly registered in SOURCE_CAPABILITIES instead of force-injected.

### Changed

- YouTube transcript candidate pool widened 3x past music videos to reach talk/review content with captions
- Reddit comment enrichment sorted by total engagement (upvotes + comments), not just upvotes
- Polymarket display shows % odds only; dollar volumes removed
- 852 tests passing

### Fixed

- Marketplace validation: duplicate `name: last30days` collision in `skills/last30days/SKILL.md` caused strict validators to reject the plugin. Resolved by renaming the internal v3 architecture spec to `last30days-v3-spec` with `user-invocable: false`. Fixed in #214 (reported by @Cody-Coyote in #204).
- Stale README link to the deleted `skills/last30days-v3/` path from the v3 directory rename. Fixed in #214.
- OpenAI Codex CLI discoverability: added `.agents/skills/last30days/SKILL.md` as a real file (Codex's loader skips symlinked files) plus `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` as the namespace marker. The skill now registers as `last30days:last30days` when Codex runs in a checkout of the repo. Fixed in #219 (inspired by @Jah-yee in #153 and @dannyshmueli on X).

## [2.9.4] - 2026-03-06

### Changed

- Move save into Python script via `--save-dir` flag - raw research data saved during the existing script Bash call, zero extra tool calls after invitation
- Remove entire "Save Research to Documents" section from SKILL.md (~45 lines removed)
- No more `📎` footer, no Bash heredoc, no `(No output)`, no multi-minute cogitation after research

## [2.9.3] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- **Critical:** Switch save from `run_in_background` to foreground Bash - background callbacks caused model to re-engage, hallucinate fake user messages, and generate unsolicited multi-paragraph responses
- Save uses foreground `cat >` heredoc (executes sub-second, no callback, no delayed notification)

## [2.9.2] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- Save research silently using background Bash heredoc instead of Write tool (eliminates "Wrote N lines..." clutter)
- Suppress follow-up text after background save completes (no more "Research briefing saved..." noise)
- Add `📎` footer line for save path instead of verbose confirmation

## [2.9.1] - 2026-03-05

### Highlights

Auto-save research briefings to `~/Documents/Last30Days/` as topic-named .md files. Every run now builds a personal research library automatically - no more manual copy-paste.

### Added

- Auto-save complete research briefings (synthesis, stats, follow-up suggestions) to `~/Documents/Last30Days/{topic-slug}.md` after every run
- Kebab-case filename generation from topic (e.g., "Claude Code skills" -> `claude-code-skills.md`)
- Duplicate topic handling: appends date suffix instead of overwriting (e.g., `claude-code-skills-2026-03-05.md`)
- Agent mode (`--agent`) also saves research files
- Brief confirmation after save: "Saved to ~/Documents/Last30Days/{slug}.md"

### Credits

- [@devin_explores](https://x.com/devin_explores) -- Inspired this feature by sharing their workflow of saving every last30days run into organized .md files ([PR #51](https://github.com/mvanhorn/last30days-skill/pull/51))

## [2.9.0] - 2026-03-05

### Highlights

ScrapeCreators Reddit as the default backend (one `SCRAPECREATORS_API_KEY` covers Reddit + TikTok + Instagram), smart subreddit discovery with relevance-weighted scoring, and top comments elevated with 10% scoring weight and prominent display.

### Added

- ScrapeCreators Reddit backend (`scripts/lib/reddit.py`) — keyword search, subreddit discovery, comment enrichment, all via `api.scrapecreators.com`
- Smart subreddit discovery with relevance-weighted scoring: frequency × recency × topic-word match, replacing pure frequency count
- `UTILITY_SUBS` blocklist to filter noise subreddits (r/tipofmytongue, r/whatisthisthing, etc.) from discovery results
- Top comment scoring: 10% weight in engagement formula via `log1p(top_comment_score)`
- Top comment rendering: `💬 Top comment` lines with upvote counts in compact and full report output
- Comment excerpt length increased from 300 → 400 chars; `comment_insights` limit raised from 7 → 10

### Changed

- `primaryEnv` switched from `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `SCRAPECREATORS_API_KEY` — one key now powers Reddit, TikTok, and Instagram
- Reddit engagement scoring formula: `0.55/0.40/0.05` (score/comments/ratio) → `0.50/0.35/0.05/0.10` (score/comments/ratio/top-comment)
- SKILL.md synthesis instructions updated to emphasize quoting top comments

### Fixed

- Utility subreddit noise in discovery (e.g., r/tipofmytongue appearing for unrelated topics)
- Reddit search no longer requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` — ScrapeCreators API handles search directly

## [2.8.0] - 2026-03-04

### Highlights

Instagram Reels as the 8th signal source, TikTok migrated from Apify to ScrapeCreators API, and SKILL.md quality improvements. One API key (`SCRAPECREATORS_API_KEY`) now covers both TikTok and Instagram.

### Added

- Instagram Reels as 8th research source via ScrapeCreators API — keyword search, engagement metrics (views, likes, comments), spoken-word transcript extraction (`scripts/lib/instagram.py`)
- `InstagramItem` dataclass, normalization, scoring (45% relevance / 25% recency / 30% engagement), deduplication, cross-source linking, and rendering
- Instagram in SKILL.md: stats template (`📸 Instagram:`), citation priority, item format description, output footer
- URL-to-name extraction examples in SKILL.md for cleaner web source display
- `--search=instagram` flag support

### Changed

- TikTok backend migrated from Apify to ScrapeCreators API (`api.scrapecreators.com`)
- `APIFY_API_TOKEN` replaced by `SCRAPECREATORS_API_KEY` in config
- SKILL.md version bumped to v2.8
- WebSearch citation instruction strengthened to prevent trailing Sources: blocks
- Security section updated: Apify → ScrapeCreators references

### Fixed

- Web stats line showing full URLs instead of plain domain names
- Trailing "Sources:" block appearing after skill invitation (WebSearch tool mandate conflict)
- Instagram/TikTok not running in web-only mode when `--search=instagram` used without Reddit/X
- `$ARGUMENTS` quoting in SKILL.md for correct flag forwarding

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-15

### Highlights

Three headline features: watchlists for always-on bots, YouTube transcripts as a 4th source, and Codex CLI compatibility. Plus bundled X search with no external CLI needed.

### Added

- Open-class skill with watchlists, briefings, and history modes (SQLite-backed, FTS5 full-text search, WAL mode) (`feat(open)`)
- YouTube as a 4th research source via yt-dlp -- search, view counts, and auto-generated transcript extraction (`feat: Add YouTube`)
- OpenAI Codex CLI compatibility -- install to `~/.agents/skills/last30days`, invoke with `$last30days` (`feat: Add Codex CLI`)
- Bundled X search -- vendored subset of Bird's Twitter GraphQL client (MIT, originally by @steipete), no external CLI needed (`v2.1: Bundle Bird X search`)
- Native web search backends: Parallel AI, Brave Search, OpenRouter/Perplexity Sonar Pro (`feat(engine)`)
- `--diagnose` flag for checking available sources and authentication status
- `--store` flag for SQLite accumulation (open variant)
- Conversational first-run experience (NUX) with dynamic source status (`feat(nux)`)

### Changed

- Smarter query construction -- strips noise words, auto-retries with shorter queries when X returns 0 results
- Two-phase search architecture -- Phase 1 discovers entities (@handles, r/subreddits), Phase 2 drills into them
- Reddit JSON enrichment -- real upvotes, comments, and upvote ratio from reddit.com/.json endpoint
- Engagement-weighted scoring: relevance 45%, recency 25%, engagement 30% (log1p dampening)
- Model auto-selection with 7-day cache and fallback chain (gpt-4.1 -> gpt-4o -> gpt-4o-mini)
- `--days=N` configurable lookback flag (thanks @jonthebeef, [#18](https://github.com/mvanhorn/last30days-skill/pull/18))
- Model fallback for unverified orgs (thanks @levineam, [#16](https://github.com/mvanhorn/last30days-skill/pull/16))
- Marketplace plugin support via `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (inspired by @galligan, [#1](https://github.com/mvanhorn/last30days-skill/pull/1))

### Fixed

- YouTube timeout increased to 90s, Reddit 429 rate limit fail-fast
- YouTube soft date filter -- keeps evergreen content instead of filtering to 0 results
- Eager import crash in `__init__.py` that broke Codex environments
- Reddit future timeout (same pattern as YouTube timeout bug)
- Process cleanup on timeout/kill -- tracks child PIDs for clean shutdown
- Windows Unicode fix for cp1252 emoji crash (thanks @JosephOIbrahim, [#17](https://github.com/mvanhorn/last30days-skill/pull/17))
- X search returning 0 results on popular topics due to over-specific queries
